== GOAL
* Implement a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to solve the customer needs. By the end of
the exercise the customer must have a usable system.
* Please do a three point estimation for each feature in effort points. Write that in the README.md

== PROBLEM BACKGROUND
In your first day as developer you are consulting for a customer who owns a textile company named Textile.Co. The company has 1000 employees.

When a new employee joins Textile.Co, the employee receives a new BADGE card imprinted
with a unique barcode, each employee has a different BADGE card.

Textile.Co bought a punch card machine that can send a HTTP’s JSON POST payloads to a
server and wants to use it to track arrivals and departures of employees. Working hours for employees are from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday to Friday.

The customer wants you to implement the following features:

== FEATURES (and 3-Point Estimations)
1. Your customer wants to be able to see which employees are arriving late.
  a. Best: 2 min.
  b. Medium: 3 hr.
  c. Worse: 4 hr.
2. Your customer wants to know which employees are not coming to work at all.
  a. Best: 2 min.
  b. Medium: 3 hr.
  c. Worse: 4 hr.
3. Your customer’s employees are complaining that the reported hours for a given period are wrong, so your customer wants to give each of his employees the opportunity to review their current period working hours report 3 days before the paycheck day.
  a. Best: 4 hr.
  b. Medium: 6 hrs.
  c. Worse: 8 hrs.

== EXTRA FEATURE
As soon as you finish and send the MVP we will provide an extra feature and we will
implement it with pair programming.

== HINTS
Make sure you commit frequent atomic commits

== TECHNOLOGY
[Stack] Rails
[Tools] Git
